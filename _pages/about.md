I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington, advised by [Dr. Jonathan Wakefield](https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/index.html). My broad research interests are in statistical demography, survival analysis, and spatial epidemiology. My dissertation projects are related to the estimation of child mortality rates using available survey and vital registration data, with a focus on the treatment of age and time. This research is in collaboration with partners in the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. I am also studying survival- and non-survival-based methods for recurrent events trials, in a project with Dr. Thomas Fleming.

I am also a [Data Science and Demography Training Program (NIH T32)](https://csde.washington.edu/training/fellowship-funding/data-science-demography-population-health-training/) fellow through the Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology at the University of Washington.

Prior to joining the Department of Biostatistics I was a researcher and post-bachelor fellow at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, where I worked on all-cause mortality estimation for the Global Burden of Disease Study, advised by Dr. Haidong Wang. I have also received a MPH in global health and health metrics from the University of Washington and a BS in mathematics from Bates College.
